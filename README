I'm a low-level C developer. I write open source, free simple and optimized software. I love free (*as in freedom*) open source software and community driven projects. Some of my favorite software is made by *suckless software* and *GNU tools*. I value privacy over everything, I despise subscription services. The modern digital world is a mess, having to navigate surveillance, censorship, capitalism, and the ever increasing use of artificial intelligence. Put the power back in the hands of the people. I enjoy minimalism and pretty looking code, I strive to find simple and compact solutions to advanced problems.
